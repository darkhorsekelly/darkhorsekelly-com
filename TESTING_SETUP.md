# Jest + RTL Baseline Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the Jest + React Testing Library (RTL) baseline implementation that has been added to the project. The setup follows the project's TDD workflow and testing standards.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Installed

The following testing dependencies were added to `package.json`:
- `jest` - Test runner
- `@types/jest` - TypeScript types for Jest
- `jest-environment-jsdom` - DOM environment for testing
- `@testing-library/react` - React component testing utilities
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - Additional DOM matchers
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation

### 2. Configuration Files

#### `jest.config.js`
- Next.js Jest configuration with custom settings
- JSDOM test environment for DOM testing
- Setup files for Jest DOM matchers
- Coverage collection configuration
- Test path exclusions

#### `jest.setup.js`
- Imports Jest DOM matchers for additional assertions

#### `types/jest.d.ts`
- TypeScript declarations for Jest and Jest DOM

### 3. Test Scripts Added

The following npm scripts were added to `package.json`:
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

### 4. Sample Components and Tests

#### `app/ui/Button.tsx`
A reusable Button component with:
- Primary and secondary variants
- Disabled state support
- Click handler support
- Tailwind CSS styling

#### `__tests__/ui/Button.test.tsx`
Comprehensive tests for the Button component:
- Rendering tests
- Interaction tests (click handling)
- Variant styling tests
- Disabled state tests
- Accessibility tests

#### `__tests__/page.test.tsx`
Tests for the main page component:
- Content rendering tests
- Navigation link tests
- Footer link tests
- Accessibility attribute tests

### 5. Test Structure

```
__tests__/
├── ui/
│   └── Button.test.tsx
├── page.test.tsx
└── README.md
```

## How to Use

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing New Tests

1. **Follow TDD Workflow**: Red → Green → Refactor
2. **Test Behavior**: Focus on what users see and do
3. **Use Semantic Queries**: Prefer `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`
4. **Keep Tests Simple**: One assertion per test when possible

### Example Test Structure

```tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import ComponentName from '../path/to/component';

describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    render(<ComponentName />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should handle user interactions', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<ComponentName onClick={handleClick} />);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

## Test Results

The baseline implementation includes:
- **2 test suites** (Button component and Page component)
- **10 passing tests** covering various scenarios
- **100% coverage** for the Button component
- **No failing tests** - all tests pass successfully

## Next Steps

With this baseline in place, you can now:

1. **Write tests for new features** following the established patterns
2. **Implement TDD workflow** for all new development
3. **Add more test utilities** as needed (e.g., custom render functions with providers)
4. **Extend test coverage** to other components and functionality
5. **Add integration tests** for more complex user workflows

## Compliance with Project Rules

This implementation follows all the established project rules:
- ✅ Uses Jest + React Testing Library as specified
- ✅ Follows TypeScript standards
- ✅ Implements TDD workflow (Red-Green-Refactor)
- ✅ Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Maintains type safety throughout
- ✅ Provides comprehensive test coverage for the baseline component

The setup is ready for immediate use and follows industry best practices for React component testing.
